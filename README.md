<h1>Mode Graphic Design Solutions</h1>
Mode Graphic Design Solutions has been an idea of mine for some time, and I'm glad I got to bring it to life through a website. I have a background in graphic design but I am still struggling with making things look exactly how I want them to with the code I've learned so far, but am hoping to gain enough skills in this program to be a front end web developer and brand designer. 

Some struggles I faced with this assignment was not understanding bootstrap as we didnt have much class time to learn the language, though after I got the hang of it through tutoring it was easier. I like how it saves me from having to write as much CSS, but also find it limiting in some aspects as well. Im looking forward to learning javascript in the next few semesters. 

I need to learn more about troubleshooting my code through the inspect tool, I find it a bit overwhelming but with my tutors showing me how to inspect things it made it a bit easier. This project I chose to make it as simple as possible so I can actually develop a good clean website without getting overwhelmed. In the future I would like to add a lot more. 

Alongside bootstrap I used the following:
